* TODO Remove Coquette
* DONE Accurate client/server time and latency measurements (try to piggyback on WebSocket pings?)
* DONE Calculate actual elapsed time when doing physics, instead of fixed interval
* TODO Ship colors - generate different colors for ships server side, sync in data
* DONE Asteroids flying around (spawn with size and velocity -- for bonus points, make them spin)
* DONE Ship drift/velocity
* TODO Move stars server side
* TODO More star variety/constellations
* TODO Update diffs instead of full updates
* DONE Server-side collision detection
* TODO Client-side collision detection
* DONE Missiles hitting things
* DONE Health
* DONE Asteroids splitting (predetermined chunk sizes and ids?)
* DONE Client disconnect -> death/disappear
* DONE Better ids for projectiles
* TODO Large game map, viewports with smart data sync
* DONE Prediction, interpolation, lag compensation, etc
* TODO Profiling/benchmarking
* DONE Health bars
* DONE Death detection
* TODO Score
* TODO Death animation
* TODO Spawn animation
* TODO Minimap/radar and/or arrows indication direction to off-screen enemies
* DONE Use gopherjs (https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) to sync game object construct and simulation logic? (not doing it)
* DONE JSON stringify update message before sending to each client (not doing it -- now we have last event id)
* TODO Wrap-around map? (probably won't have time for view-ports)
* DONE Try new heartbeat-request-update model
* DONE Use SMA for clock diff
* DONE Compare msgpack, LZW encoding, protobuf (create some sample data with a few ships, a bunch of projectiles & asteroids)
* DONE Fix deletion of dead objects -- either auto-delete after X seconds, or track last-synced timestamp of each connected client, and maintain a "low water mark" in game, pass that into history on tick so it knows what it can cull
* DONE Split collision detection into a separate step after all positions have been updated
* DONE Add ship velocity to projectiles
* TODO When position is incorrect, smooth it with a vector instead of jumping right there
* TODO Replace panic and log.Fatal statements with error logs, so at least an error won't crash it
* TODO Measure server timestamps as time since boot? (To make the numbers smaller and hence cut down on data)
* TODO Smarter updates: if asterdoid created time <= last update, remove shape data and other non-changing info?
* TODO Re-swawn new asteroids after some die
* TODO Do 3-phase collision detection -- first a really rough estimate, then second phase checking hitbox intersection, then third phase of actual ploygon intersection
* TODO Add alien space-ships
* TODO Randomize spawn points! (especially with ship-ship collisions)
* TODO Faster collision detection? -> http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-use-quadtrees-to-detect-likely-collisions-in-2d-space--gamedev-374

Notes from arcade game:
* Bullets are very bright, pulse, and leave both a bright trail and a slight trail , looking like shooting starts.
* Ship has subtle flame in rear when accelerating, leaves subtle trail.
* Alien spaceships that move around erratically trying to kill you.
* Asteroids are more blocky, leave alpha trails.
* Ship breaks apart into lines when killed.

When hitting asteroid:
* If small, kill it
* If not small, kill and create two new asteroids with ~1/2 the size, in deterministic manner
